## Text Embedding Models
### Introduction
Text embedding models create numerical representations from text inputs. 
This ability to encode text and capture its semantic meaning means that embedding models underpin 
many types of AI applications, like semantic search engines and recommendation engines.

### Course Overview
In this course, you'll learn how to harness OpenAI's Embeddings model via 
the OpenAI API to create embeddings from text datasets and begin developing real-world applications. 
You'll also take a big step towards creating production-ready applications 
by learning about vector databases to efficiently store and query embedded texts.
